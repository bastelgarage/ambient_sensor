# Bastelgarage.ch Ambient Sensor Kit

The Bastelgarage.ch Ambient Sensor is a kit which is available in three different flavors.

- Simple
- Outdoor
- Deluxe

All three type are based on a basic set of components: An ESP32 development board, cables, and a half-size breadboard. They are suitable for beginners and advance users. Children may need the assistance of a parent to complete all tasks. All kits contains cables which will allow one to include more sensors without soldering. The only soldering which is required is to mount the pins to the sensor and the ESP32 development board.
