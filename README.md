# Bastelgarage.ch Environment sensor

The Bastelgarage.ch Environment sensor is a kit which is available in three different flavors.

- Simple
- Outdoor
- Deluxe

All three type are based on a basic set of components: An ESP32 development board and a half-size breadboard. They are suitable for beginners and advance users. Children may need the assistance of a parent to complete all tasks.

The "Simple Sensor" contains additionally a BME280 for measuring the temperature, the pressure, and the humidity, and a plywood box. The box can be put on a table or placed on a wall.

The "Outdoor Sensor kit" is shipped with a water-proof box, a cable passage, a pressure equalization valve, and sealed DS18B20 sensor for measuring the temperature. The battery should allow you to run this kit for a couple of months without re-charging.

The "Deluxe Environment Sensor" is for indoor use only. The elegant plywood contains a display that  is showing the current conditions including temperature, pressure, and humidity with a BME280. Plus the air quality.

It is possible to attach more sensors to each type kit. The used controller has free analog and digital inputs pins. It would also be possible to include actuators like LEDs or relays. All kits contains cables which will allow one to include more sensors without soldering.

The kits will be available at [Maker Faire Zurich](https://www.makerfairezurich.ch/de/) and later in the online shop of [Bastelgarage.ch](https://bastelgarage.ch/).
